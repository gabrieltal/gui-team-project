## GUI Project
This is a group project for a GUI class.
Project utilized Swing the Java GUI widget toolkit.

There are three games involved and whenever you make a mistake you lose points and the goal is to maintain the highest score.

* First game is Hangman. There is a set library of words and the player has to solve the words in order to move onto the next game.
* The next game is a matching game. There are 5 circles of varying colors. A colored word will show up. The word will be on of the colors and its color is a different color. You must select the circle that matches the text, not its color. The circles will all switch to a different color each round. 5 rounds of color matching until you proceed to the final game.
* The final game is Sudoku which is self explanatory.

The final screen will be the HighScore screen if you maintained a high score.
