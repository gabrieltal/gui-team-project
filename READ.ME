This is a group project for a GUI class.
Project utilized Swing the Java GUI widget toolkit.
There are three games involved and whenever you make a mistake you lose points and the goal is to maintain the highest score.
There is first there is the Hangman game. There is a set library of words and the player must play hangman and survive to play the next game.
The next game is a matching game. There are 5 circles of varying colors. A word will show up.
The word is a color and it is also colored a different color. You must select the circle that matches the text and not its color.
The circles will all switch to a different color each round. 5 rounds of color matching until you proceed to the final game.
The final game is Sudoku which is self explanatory.
The final screen will be the HighScore screen if you maintained a high score.
